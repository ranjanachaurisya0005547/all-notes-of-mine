3.After client side data vailidated 
    a)How to the data to the server on clicking submit button
    b)How to send the data without submit the data
    (if input type not submit the use Ajax to the data on the server and may be type is button)
4.Considering submit from submit button 
    a)Identify the method type by default method is get Type
    <form action="output.php" onsubmit="return vailidate()">
    By default method is get
    otherwise you can make it post

===========================================
Difference b/w get and post method:
g.1)get is bydefault value of the method attribute of the form tag
p.1)Post is the script value of the method attribute of the form tag
----
g.2)Get is a insecure method 
p.2)post is the secure method 

----
g.3)get result in the generation of Querystring
p.3)post doesnot generates QueryString hence the data is sent in encoded standard and data remain hidden
Ex:
Any String in url followed by "?" as key and value pair separated by "&" is called QueryString or quotetion String.
in GET request:? =1
Rather in Post ? =0
Multiple Query String are used in the framework.

filename:output.php
email:___________
name:_____
gender:______
url:
output.php?email:ranjana@gmail.com&name:ranjana&gender:female
          | key |      value      |(&)separator
		  |
	 Query Mark
          |---------------QueryString-----------------------|

===============================================================================
g.4)In GET request only limited amount data can be send to the server
p.4)But in post request more than 1024 charecter can be supplied 

g.5)In get Request file can not be uploaded
p.5)In Post request any file can be uploaded infact a movie of 5GB 
    But Server must allow in apache Server Max_upload_limit=2MB
	=>You can change the max_upload_limit for the file upload inside the php.ini file
	enctype=multipart/form-data is important to be used with post method in case of file uploading.
	(enctype=xwww-urlencode/data2.1) Its used before html 5.0 versions.
	(enctype->encryption type,multipart->multi partition,form-data->that means data come from the form)
	
	Explanation:Whenever a data is send to the server three things send to the server
	1)url
	2)header
	     content-type:application/json
		 https_client:off
		 ssl_peer_verify:true
		 -------------------
		 -------------------
		 -------------------
		 cache-expiry:100Ms
		 pragma:
		 
        We modify the header for downloading the image
        Its write the header of the file to change the behaviour of the some operations.
        header("Content-Type:application/Raw-data");
	3)body
	   |formdata
	   |formencoded data
	   |raw data /json data
	
	   How to send data in json format:
	   data:json
	   content-type:application/json
	   Encoding:UTF-8
	   {
	      "name":"ranjana",
		  "gender":"female",
		  "file"="asbcjdshdnxcbvbfhsdshhghhbcnbnahsjhnasbcjdshdnxcbvbfhsdshhghhbcnbnahsjhnasbcjdshdnxcbvbfhsd
		        asbcjdshdnxcbvbfhsdshhghhbcnbnahsjhnasbcjdshdnxcbvbfhsdshhghhbcnbnahsjhnasbcjdshdnxcbvb
				fhsdshhghhbcnbnahsjhnasbcjdshdnxcbvbfhsdshhghhbcnbnahsjhnasbcjdshdnxcbvbfhsdshhghhbcnbnahsjhn";
	   }
============================================================================
g.6)Get request is cachable
p.6)Post request is not cachable

g.7)Get request can be Bookmarked
p.7)Post Request can not be Bookmarked

API Level Diff b/w Get & post
g.8)Get request do not have any additional security can be publically accessible
