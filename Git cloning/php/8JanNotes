What is the Activity tracking in server ?
1)generally there are two types of resources 
   i)serverfull
  ii)serverless
   
serverfull resources acquires complete tracking of user and they response
over the server few or more resources can not be shared in if resources is accessed from server 
protocol medium.
Ex:PHP(its compulsory to intract with the server)
Tracking:Enable or disable
1=Enable its can be tracked =enable 0
0=Disable do not track =disable 1
[HTTP_DNT]=>DNT=Donot track

Serverless resources acquires incomplete tracking of the user and they can response over the server without 
direct intraction of the server .
They are not tracked by any server in this case in serverless resources can access any type of the data from 
any source.
EX:HTML(it is not compulsory to intract with the server)
Tracking:Disable

=====================================
Working with the session super global variable.
$_SESSION:It is a super global variable which can be accessed.....

============================================
$_FILES:
This super global variable is used to handle file uploading in server.
It is a two dimensional Array.
Files can be any type..
1)Bninary
Example of Binary:
Media files mp3,mp4,pdf,zipped or any other mime type.

2)Non-Binary Files:
Example:
All text formate files are non binary files..
.tmp 
.log
.txt
.dat
.doc
.csv
.html its the non binary files
.xml its also the non binary files

====
Uploading means:
Read one source and write on another source.
Read one Destination and write to the another destination

====
copy and move:
copy:First create the File
     Read from the one file
	 Write to the the another file
	 Memory release of the file pointer
	
Move:First create the File
     Read from the one file
	 Write to the the another file
	 Memory release of the second file pointer
	 fseek(-1)	 
	 
	 
	 Like In c Language:
	 char ch;
	 File* fp1;
	 File* fp2;
	 fp1=&File;
	 fp2=&File;
	 fp1=fopen("c:/something.txt",r);
	 fp2=fopen("d:/something.txt",w);
	 
	 while(ch==fread(fb1)!=EOL)
	 {
	    fwrite(fp2,ch);
	 }
	 fclose(fp1);
	 fclose(fp2);
===============================================
Steps how to upload files on the server:
Internal Working:
When ever we try to upload any file  a upload request is generated and file pointer is initialized.

Who initialized to the file pointer ?
inbuit server are responsible to the initialized the file pointer.
1)Apache
2)PHP CLI Server

By default file pointer has source address of the temp folder location in the server folder of the any server.
Apache:tmp root
PHP Inbuilt Server :PHP tmp folder

What is this tmp folder ?
it is default folder where every file handling is performed by server
Like Storing file based session by file name sess_......
2)using any file with .tmp extension

=>such file defined inside the php.ini file

Now the file which is to be uploaded from browser required key parameters 
1)file_upload=on  in ini setting of the server
2)Path should be available to tmp folder 
  upload_tmp_dir=...
  define the path
  
Note: in the ini files  ; means disabled to enable directive remove ; 
in http.conf # means disable to enable remove #

3)File uploading is now ready 
Steps for code:
---------------
<form action="#" method="post" enctype="multipart">
<input type="file" name="xyz"/>
<input type="submit"/>
</form>

Srever Side Code:
print_r($_FILES);
//Its generate the two dimensional array.
name Key=file name
tmp_name=file address of tmp folder.
error:Its show the error if happend during upload.
size:it gives the total memory reserved by the tmp folder.

file Uploading:
#save =file.php
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<h1>$_FILES in PHP</h1>
<form action="upload.php" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
<p>
<input type="file" name="files"/>
</p><br>
<input type="submit"/>
</form>
</body>
</html>

#save=upload.php
<?php

//print_r($_FILES);
/*
Output:

Array ( [files] => Array ( [name] => task1.html [type] => text/html [tmp_name] =>
 C:\xampp\tmp\php3D41.tmp [error] => 0 [size] => 1890 ) )
*/

$up_files=$_FILES['files'];
$filename=$up_files['name'];
$type=$up_files['type'];
$tmpname=$up_files['tmp_name'];
$error=$up_files['error'];
$size=$up_files['size'];


echo "Filename = {$filename} <br/>";
echo "Type = {$type} <br/>";
echo "tmpname = {$tmpname} <br/>";
echo "Error = {$error} <br/>";
echo "FILE SIZE = {$size}<br/> ";

?>

Output:

Filename = modal.html
Type = text/html
tmpname = C:\xampp\tmp\php8405.tmp
Error = 0
FILE SIZE = 1401
=================
tmp folder:It is the that folder where the all the file handling process store here.
its create the tmp file for the normal request otherwise its create the sess before the session related files.
php.ini server is production server/Live server.
production server/Live server:
Its always be in the public domain

cli server is a development server/testing server/staging server
development server/testing server/staging server:
Its always be in the private domain
