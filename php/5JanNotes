Request Handling in PHP:
Here we respond according to the legal response only and request can be found using 
$_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'];(request are get/post u found by this syntax)

===========================================================
on The client side who tell the method type?
method tells the method type

Whose tell the method type on the server side?
Answer is $_SERVER tells about it.

How many types of request?
That's the http request methods...
GET
POST
PUT 
patch
delete
options
lock
head
------
-----
Most Widely used request are ....
Get :show the record/response
post:You want to post or add some data
put: changing complete  data of updating fully 
patch: Partially update patch Ex:change password 
delete:Destroies(delete) the record/response
=======================================================
Http request with database:
CRUD(create read/retrieve update the data delete the data)
C:create (insert)
R:read/retrieve(select)
U:update the data(update)
D:delete the data(delete)

Note:
http protocol version:
http/1.1 version
http/2.1 version

===================
create=> http/1.1 POST 200 ok
Read=>http/1.1 GET 200 ok
Update=>http/1.1 Put 200 ok
      =>http/1.1 PATCH 201  created
Delete=>http/1.1 Delete 200 ok
After that if try to retrieve data then generate this error
read=>http/1.1 GET 404 Not Found	  
	  
==============================================
who will decide the send method is get/post on the client side ?
its not decided by the form tag or method attribute of form tag.

=>Ascept post u can supply any thing inside the method attribute of the form tag its always return get .


id is used at client side but name attribute of the form control is used at the server side

==========================
Its is for multiple form contro
function_name($_POST)//function calling print_r($_POST)
function function_name($data)//function definition and here $data is a variable
{
$name=$data['uname'];
echo $name;
}

===========
Simplest Approach to get the data from the form control when the method is post
$name=$_POST['uname'];
echo $name;

============
=>Its the another way to find the data from the form tag
if($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']=='POST')
{
   $name = $_POST['uname'];
   echo $name;
}
else
{
  header("location:input.html");
}
