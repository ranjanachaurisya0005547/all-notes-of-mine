How to auto add and commit ?

How to manage tracking of all files  other than few files?
cmd>git add --all or git add -A
cmd>git add .

remove the file which u want to untracked :
cmd>git rm --cached filename -f

what is .gitignore  file:
it is special file which trackes untracked files and do not add them.

best way is:
to use .gitignore file to untracked a particular file.
cmd>touch .gitignore
Note:git do not tracke any files registered inside .gitignore file .
if you want .gitignore file itself not be tracked you can add .gtignore insede the .gtignore
file but .gtignore file will not be added in staging area  then next time when you want to clone
the project you would not able to know which files to working under tracking and which file
to ignore.

.gitlock (when all the file committed then its created automatically)
*.html(Its called git labeling)
. files called special files its hidden file for operating system.

git diff cmd:
used to find out the diff b/w last committted code with the latest modified code.
cmd>git diff filename
diff means:(diffrence)

how to checkout last code from a file:
git checkout <filename>

how to checkout the lastcode deleted from a deleted file:
file name missing
checkout the branch 
cmd>git checkout <filename>
cmd>git checkout master
You will get the deleted file 
steps:
1)git status(find file_name)
2)git checkout file_name -f(now you get your deleted file)

1)git status
2)git checkout index.html(reverse back the code)
3)git status

1)git status
2)git commit -a -m "message" (add and commit both together)
3)git status

=>If file was deleted then first check the git status then checkout and now your deleted file 
is automatically built

if changes inside the pre defined code then run git diff

git checkout filename
now u get the previous committed code

How to checkout from full project:
cmd>git checkout -f
here -f flag will revert back all the changes from the project of current branch 

Q1:A empty folder can not be trapped
Ans:Minimum one file must exist.
Q2:checkout cannot be performed at one condition:
Ans:in case of git init 
since there is no commit file checkout cannot be until and unless initial commit.
