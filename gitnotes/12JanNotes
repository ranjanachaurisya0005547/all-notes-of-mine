How to work with GitHub or any Remote repository: 
There are millions of online server which allow VCS(virsion contrl system) Integration.
VCS here referes to version control system which means you have multiple developers working
under agile agile modelor srum model or sprint model.

Each(srum/model) sprint is committed by different developer as a collab and 
each srum is a part of a branch.

Git Hub is popular online server mostly use for submitting our commits.
Is GitHub only the possibke way ?
No,We have bit-keeper (git older srever repository),bitbucket,aws,Git Lab etc.
=>Pagination
=>Infinite pagination 

=>GitHub Owned By Microsoft.
=>You can create two types of repository
1)public:Any one using internet can access.
  clone:No permission is required in pull.
  push:requires permission and credentials
  collab:requires permission and credentials
  forks:requires permission and credentials
  
2)private:You are owner with single access
  clone:requires permission of the owne for pull and such type of request is called as pull 
  request called as pull request.
  push:requires permission and credentials
  collab:requires permission and credentials
  forks:requires permission and credentials
  
  How to create first repo:
  1)Login your GitHub account
  2)Access code may be asked to login into gmail and get the OTP send by GitHub.
   [its may possible or may not possible]
  3)create repository on the right hand side
    Before create a repo you should have following things ready
    i)ownership type:public or private.
    ii)Unique url for repo (repo-name)
    iii) ReadMe file(optional) :Its is local documentation(txt file u can read on text editor)
    iv)	.gitignore file(optional):Which files or folder to commit or not
	v)(optional)License
	Tag Line and description :Information about the project.
	
	Now you can create the repository.
  
  What is putty ?
  git diff filename(last ommitted and latest changes code)
  
  1)modified the code(and see the Git Gui)
  
  1)create a new branch(git branch ravi)
  2)switch the branch(git checkout ravi)
  4)now create the file like(file1.html)
  5)send the staging(git add file1.html)
  6)now commit 
  7)see the git status (if u found no commits yet)
  8)then again checkout the master branch and here you merge the branches
  cmd>git merge branch_name
  9)now you checkout from the branch master 
  10)you check branches are merge not ,use this cmd 
   cmd>git log
   You get the Output there 
  
  
  for merger two branches:
  cmd>git merge branchname(Like git merge ravi)
  
 =>git remote master
 =>git remote add origin https://url(for added to the git hub)
 =>git remote -v (to added or not)
 
 =>git push
 =>git push origin branchname(master)
 how to push the code to server:
 1)add the remote url
 git remote add origin <url...>
 git remote add origin <repository_url>
 git remote add origin <https://githun.com/woner_id/repo_name/fetch> 
 git remote add origin <https://githun.com/woner_id/repo_name/push>
 
 How to push the code:
 git push <origin> <branch_name>
 git push <https://githun.com/woner_id/repo_name/master
 
 You have Any other branch:
 git push https://githun.com/woner_id/repo_name/ravi
 git push <origin> ravi
 
 origin is variable name:
 git remote add url https://githun.com/woner_id/repo_name/
 
 Push in the url:
 git push url master 
 git ask for the credential and Push the entire with the branch.
 
 How to clone the project:
 git clone <public-repo>
 git clone <private-repo><ssh-key neccesory>
 
 How to setup a New branch and Switch to it:
 git branch master Existed
 
 Now create the New Branch:
 cmd>git checkout -b <branch_name>
 o/p>creating a new branch a switching the that branch directly
 
 
 
 for immidiate switch to the branch:
 cmd>git checkout -b branch_name;
